Hey all,

There are going to be 6 .tscn files that will have the benchmarks for the 100, 1,000 and 10,000 crows of both VAT and skeletal variety. If you want to check one out just make sure you have them selected and visible in the viewport and press the Run Current Scene button at the top right. Alternatively, you can press F6.
